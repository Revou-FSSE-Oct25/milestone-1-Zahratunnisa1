This is my personal website where in it, you can know my background professional career, some of my mini project and personal contact like WA,gitHUB, gmail. And also i tell you why i find my new interest in IT world and still trying for hopefully it can be my next professional career journey. 


## ✨ Main Feature
## 🎨 Modern design
## 💻 Responsive Layout (📱📱 mobile friendly)
## 🧊 Grid Layout


## Some of fitur that i add on this like grid fitur, little animation (using hover CSS) responsive layout in CSS for this web can suitable in some device like hp,personal computer. Responsive in Mobile first principe, in less than 600px, tablet for min-width 600 px and personal-computer 1024px. Little animation can looked in CSS code :
.box1:hover,
  .box2:hover,
  .box3:hover {
    transform: translateY(-6px) scale(1.02);
    box-shadow: 0 12px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);
  }
 
## where i using hover to make my grid have a little moves when i put the cursor on it. 

## I try to using Google Font to make my web looks better, and also because recently we finish learning modul in milestone 2 where's one of them teach me about custom Font. Here's the code in my index.css :
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Lato';
  src: url('/fonts/font-child/Lato/Lato-Regular.ttf');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
}

## In this milestone , also i must to submit this assignment on GitHUB. Learning GitHUB gives me a little potret how about the real a software engineer life be likes, make me can imagine how if one day i have to do a company project and it's not just a "project", it's BIG Project. And its really hard if i handle own by myself so i need to collaborate with other software engineer. Even though for this assigment i handle this by myself and also a little help by AI. Ai is something very good tools nowadays as my co-partner to debugging my code, its not a problem to using AI as long as we can make sure that we understand what we write on HTML and CSS or any other programming languages.
